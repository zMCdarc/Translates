  '81': '&6About: &7Feudal is a minecraft server plugin which creates an open world
    RPG gameplay in minecraft.  You can create kingdoms (groups).  You group together
    with other players and can ally with others.  You get to fight others to take
    their land and money.  When you first start you get to setup your character which
    include your social class and profession and your attributes (skills).  There
    are five attributes: Strength, Toughness, Speed, Stamina, and Luck.  Strength
    increases how fast you can mine and it gives a booster to all forms of attacks
    to players and mobs.  Toughness increases your health and regeneration speed.  Speed
    increases how fast you can run or walk.  Stamina decreases the rate your hunger
    bar goes down.  Luck makes you have a higher chance for about anything which has
    a chance of happening.  You can level up your profession and attributes by doing
    the job for your profession.  For example, if you are a logger then you level
    up if you cut down trees.  For more information or help about feudal do /feudal
    tutorial.'
